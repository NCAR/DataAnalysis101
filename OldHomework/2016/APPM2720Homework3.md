#APPM 2720 Homework 3 

Due Monday of Week 3 (January 25,2016)

Please send me your plots and comments by 
email: nychka@ucar.edu and 
with the subject: APPM2720 Homework 3

In the [Week2](http://www.image.ucar.edu/~nychka/Temp/APPM2720/Week2) class folder work through the R
script **Rapply.R** .

Note that for the datasets in these examples you can either load them from the Week2 folder or if you have installed the ```dataWorkshop``` package then 

```
library( dataWorkshop)
data(BoulderTemperature)
data( AudiA4)
```
will load these for you. 

OK now the homework ...  in the R script you will see near the end two questions to answer:

1. Q Make boxplots for the monthly temperatures  in BoulderTemperature. Which months have the  most similar distributions temperatures?
 
2. Q Use the formula format to make boxplots of the Audi A4 prices by year. Which years seem to have outliers?

If you find these easy try the EXTRA CREDIT question!
