The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) is an organization in the United States that investigates UFO sightings and/or alien contacts. NUFORC has been in continuous operation since 1974. It was founded in 1974 by Robert J. Gribble. It has catalogued almost 90,000 reported UFO sightings over its history, most of which were in the United States. In addition to record keeping, the center has provided statistics and graphs to assist others looking for information.
