# R basics

# what is in the workspace??
  ls()

# c combines  sets of numbers (or datasets)
X<- c( 2,3,20)

# now recheck workspace
ls()

# print out X
X

# reassign X to another name

X2 <- X

# remove the other version 

rm( X)

X3<- c( 3,4,5)

#Q how would you combine X2 and X3 to make a new data set ?

#Q What is the difference between  test <- X3 and  "test" <- X3 ?

#Q How would you create the data set with the name Donald Trump ?

#Q How would you save this R script with your modifications?
