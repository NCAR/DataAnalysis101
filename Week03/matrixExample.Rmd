Create a small matrix of numbers to do some examples

```{r}
look<- matrix( 1:12, ncol=4, nrow=3)
look
```
Create an NA
```{r}
look[2,3] <- NA
look
look2<- is.na( look)
look2

 look==4 

```

Applying over rows and columns

```{r}
apply( look, 1, "max")

apply( look, 2, "max")

```

Here is an image plot of this matrix
```{r}
image(1:3, 1:4, look, col=rainbow(256))
```

Here is an image plot of this matrix
using the fields function that adds a legend
```{r}
library(fields)
image.plot(1:3, 1:4, look, col=rainbow(256))
```
