APPM2720 Week5 Homework 6

## Reading a data set into R
Due  midnight Wednesday February 10 

- Find a small or moderate size data set and read this into R
creating an R dataset.

- Write out you data set as an R binary file using the 
````save```` function

- Create a simple graphical summary of your data (histogram, scatterplot, boxplots etc.)

Please mail a description of what the data is and where you found it (for example a web address if that is approporaite). This should be detailed enough so that someone can access this data set.  Attach your R binary data set file ( the ````.rda```` file) to me along with your plot.
