```{r}
# handy way to avoid printing messages from the libraries 
 suppressMessages(library( dataWorkshop))
#library( dataWorkshop)
```
Now start by loading some data. 
```{r}
data( AudiA4)
Y<- AudiA4$price
X<- AudiA4$mileage
```

 And the required scatterplot
 
```{r}
plot( X,Y)
```

Display as code but do not run ( just omit the {r})
Use this when the code has an error but you still want to create the final markdown document.

## Help! This does not work
```
plot(X1,Y)
```
Try something else 

```{r}
plot( X, Y, log="y")
```
