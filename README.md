<span>**Introduction**</span>

Data science is a new field that combines mathematics, computer science
and statistics with the goal of answering questions and discovering new
information from data. Some examples are: 

* How should I buy a used car on
cars.com?

* Where will the next flu outbreak occur? 

* How is the climate
changing in Colorado? 

* How do you forecast the electrical power consumption of a
supercomputer?
 
These kind of practical questions require skills in
wrangling data sets into forms for analysis, using graphics to explore
relationships among variables, writing programs to do statistical
analysis, and communicating the results in nontechnical language.

The goal of this course is to expose students to data analysis and
discovery using data science. In the process students will learn how to
write programs in the R language and generate figures and reports. R is
a community-based data analysis environment that is free and a standard
in data science and statistics. It is a flexible language similar to
Matlab and python, is fun to use, and is good for learning how to
program. The course will also introduce students to some modern data
analysis tools including regression and smoothing, multivariate
analysis, clustering, spatial prediction and image analysis. Where it is
appropriate students can adopt data sets and project that follow their
own interests and majors.

Some of the statistical and mathematical background for the analysis
techniques will be given but the emphasis will be on solving real data
problems and learning how to work with these methods in R. We will take
the approach that many sophisticated and advanced methods can be
appreciated and used within the context of particular data sets if
students have a clear ideas of the analysis goals and an understanding
of how the data is collected or generated. This kind of understanding is
a practical complement to the more mathematical development that would
occur in other statistics or computer science courses.

<span>**Course Goals**</span>

1.  Become skillful writing programs and generating reports in R
    and RStudio.

2.  Learn how to explore and check data sets using graphics and
    other statistics.

3.  Develop skills in manipulating and transforming a data set into more
    useful formats.

4.  Develop skills in visualizing and summarizing univariate and
    multivariate data.

5.  Learn how to match a statistical method to a particular type of data
    set or question.

6.  Develop skills for communicating the results of a data analysis.

Course Outline 
==============

For most weeks the first lecture will present some new topics with
subsequent lectures focusing on hands-on exercises in class. The grading
will be based on weekly homework and several (short) take home quizes,
and project to be presented in class. Data analysis and programming are
skills that are developed by doing. The strategy is to have many short
and regular points of evaluation instead of a few big tests. The take
home quizzes will typically feature a few practical questions for a
specific data set and will allow students to use their own PC, use the
web, and also give more time to think about solutions. For many parts of
the course, students will be encouraged to work together in small groups
to develop collaborative skills and in particular the final project can
be done as a team.

Here is how the material might be blocked out for a 15 week course (two lectures/week)
